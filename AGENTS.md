We are building a specification of a set of events based on a domain our domain model (doc/domainmodel/police-incident-incident.md).

I want to develop a list of all events with a corresponding UML class diagram for each event.
We'll use the Mermaid notation.
Ensure that we always specify the multiplicity of all associations.
We will also type the attributes.
Use composition to show nesteed data structures

In addition to the model, we want to specify the effect that the event should have on the domain model (e.g., an object has been created is linked to some existing object, the attribute values should match x,y,z).

Each event should be specifified in their own markdown file under doc/events.
